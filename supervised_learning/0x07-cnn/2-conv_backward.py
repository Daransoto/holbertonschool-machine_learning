def conv_backward(dZ, A_prev, W, b, padding="same", stride=(1, 1)):
    """
    Performs back propagation over a convolutional layer of a neural network.
    dZ is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, h_new, w_new, c_new) containing the
     partial derivatives with respect to the unactivated output of the
     convolutional layer.
        m is the number of examples.
        h_new is the height of the output.
        w_new is the width of the output.
        c_new is the number of channels in the output.
    A_prev is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, h_prev, w_prev, c_prev) containing
     the output of the previous layer.
        h_prev is the height of the previous layer.
        w_prev is the width of the previous layer.
        c_prev is the number of channels in the previous layer.
    W is a numpy.ndarray of shape (kh, kw, c_prev, c_new) containing the
     kernels for the convolution.
        kh is the filter height.
        kw is the filter width.
    b is a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, 1, 1, c_new) containing the biases
     applied to the convolution.
    padding is a string that is either same or valid, indicating the type of
     padding used.
    stride is a tuple of (sh, sw) containing the strides for the convolution.
        sh is the stride for the height.
        sw is the stride for the width.
    Returns: the partial derivatives with respect to the previous layer
     (dA_prev), the kernels (dW), and the biases (db), respectively.
