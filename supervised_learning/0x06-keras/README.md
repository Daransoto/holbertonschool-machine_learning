### Description

This project is about using keras to build models.

### Mandatory Tasks

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-sequential.py](0-sequential.py) | Builds a neural network with the Keras library. |
| [1-input.py](1-input.py) | Builds a neural network with the Keras library, without using Sequential. |
| [2-optimize.py](2-optimize.py) | Sets up Adam optimization for a keras model with categorical crossentropy loss and accuracy metrics. |
| [3-one_hot.py](3-one_hot.py) | Converts a label vector into a one-hot matrix. |
| [4-train.py](4-train.py) | Trains a model using mini-batch gradient descent. |
| [5-train.py](5-train.py) | Previous task, but also analyzes validaiton data. |
| [6-train.py](6-train.py) | Previous task, but also trains the model using early stopping. |
| [7-train.py](7-train.py) | Previous task, but also trains the model with learning rate decay. |
